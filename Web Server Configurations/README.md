# Web Server Configurations

This section will contain guides on how to configure plugins for use with either one of the two most common web-servers currently in production. Parts of these guides can be used with alternative web-servers but these must be configured under the understanding they are not officially supported.

>[!Note]
>Additionally, not all plugins support every type of web-servers in the same way. Using one over the other in some circumstances may result in slightly different outcomes to the one provided in our documentation.
