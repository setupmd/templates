# Premium Plugin Configurations

Sometimes premium plugins such as litebans comes along and it turns out to be a great addition, server owners adopt it and it becomes a standard go-to plugin and because of that people want some 'staring points' for the configuration files and that's what the section of the repository is for.

When creating a new template for this category under no circumstances should JAR files / links to unofficial storefronts for premium plugins ever be listed within your pull requests. You are welcome to link the official spigot entry.
