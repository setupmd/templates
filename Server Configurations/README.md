# Server Configurations

This section contains pre-configured files which can be used for your servers. These files are considered 'pre-optimised' and shouldn't require any additional tweaking for the majority of players / servers. Larger servers may need to fine tune some of these configurations.


### Spigot Servers
If you're using spigot, firstly it's recommended to migrate away and use a fork like Paper, Purpur or Petal and secondly you should grab a copy of the below files.

	- server.properties
	- bukkit.yml
	- spigot.yml
